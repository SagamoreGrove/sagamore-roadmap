This is going to be the roughest of drafts for one of the intended goals of SagamoreGrove.

Firstly, the goal is to introduce exposure between the Pioneer Valley region in Western Massachusetts,
the expanding Web3 network, DeFi, the novel Internet of Jobs, and a novel concept of microcosmic DAO clustering.
The goal of the microDAO is to implement autonomous financial activity at a household level, and introduce that
activity to increasing layers of local governance and societal goods/services.

The first goal is to create a protocol for a critical mass threshold to ensure self-regulatory sustainability.  This means that the incentive will only be fully issued once a number of microDAO's have been registered. The methodology for registering known persons,
 with or without autonomy, should be some Sybil-resistant hurdle via social media. This allows, assuming compliance with social media TOS, a large group of minors with agency to have representation and access to compensation. 
 In terms of public regulatory compliance, this contractual structure would be managed by heads of household.

To increase accessibility, I propose that this household structure be matriarchally based, and have a corollary structure for single working-age adults. This implies that minors are always protected by the umbrella of heads of household, but could hypothetically empancipate themselves financially with submission of proof of a working permit.

The layer above microDAOs should address local governance. In addition to the critical mass threshold, there should be issuance to
municipal treasury structures, to be comprised of public officers in that municipality, such as town treasurers. This municipal structure should have a bicameral process: the first "house" can propose changes to that MTS via public, sybil-resistant petitions,
 or by the officers therein. In order to increase representation, I propose that all microDAOs have metadata tags denoting their proximity or inclusion in certain municipalities. 
 This should not exclude other microDAOs, but should emphasize that those most affected should have the most influential vote. The second "house" will ratify based on this weighted system, pending a better voting protocol.

Another issue is the weight of first movers in deciding the consequences for newly introduced members of the greater community. There should be a voluntary process by which first movers can exchange their received incentives for providing liquidity to DeFi, and in return receive tokenized access to goods/services in development. This should be almost identical to alpha/beta testers of software.

With regards to DeFi, I propose a novel protocol that diverts fees to multiple treasury structures, including the aforementioned MTS, and also including a self-scaling public good, such as subsistence and/or renewable energy collecting farms,
 or water collection/purification. In the Pioneer Valley, this would need to comply with wetlands conservation and safety regulations,
 but should be considered, as this protocol should scale internationally, and thusly be implemented in arid/semi-arid environments where impoverished populations can greatly benefit.
 DeFi that is not tethered to physical development for the community's sake can grow out of control, and it is imperative that we consider the advancement of our communities as the paramount abstract goal of SagamoreGrove.

To solidify this structure in the spirit of regulatory compliance, I propose a chapterized nonprofit structure that can be branched between municipalities. This should be the bridge to MTSs, and be hardened against manipulation.
