This roadmap repository will be the starting point for visualizing and articulating the details of Sagamore Grove.

To preface, other markdowns have been written as parameters to facilitate more capable experts to get into the weeds
and explain first principles and next steps.

The other function of this repository is to be a launchboard for all IoJ, or Internet of Jobs, prompts. Hopefully this environment is suitably described to allow such an endeavor.

Just as a disclaimer, the initially attainable goals are to set up a decentralized ID protocol and a local, multilayered cluster of DAOs. In other words, what we are trying to accomplish is initial understanding of what our capabilities are as anonymous, powerless peers.
 This is not a finalized state. Not by a long shot. We need to build a foundation; files like IPCP.md are meant to inspire the attitude that we can orient ourselves.

The primary goal for now is to translate discussions here and in other forums to a working landing site for the project, with a far more appealing and pragmatic roadmap. This file will be updated in the coming months to further explain and illustrate potential visions and constituent projects.
