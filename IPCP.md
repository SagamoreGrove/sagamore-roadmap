This is the roughest of drafts for the long-term goal of SagamoreGrove: introducing immutable consensus for interplanetary public goods and services.

The interplanetary filesystem, otherwise known as the IPFS, is designed to host redundant data with identical content characteristics. However, it does not address physical redundancy in the face of planetary disaster.
 If the human race is meant to survive and thrive in the solar system, there must be a open standard and protocol for autonomous, peer to peer astronavigation, telemetry, and telescopy. 
 The sum of these attributes are the necessary format by which human-made craft and broadcast can be maintained without reliance on Earth, its inhabitants, or its proprietary intellectual properties.

Firstly, consensus protocols that progress in increments of 10 minutes are nonviable for interplanetary participation. There must be intercommunication between such protocols and high-latency peer to peer communication.

Secondly, there is a growing potential for cascading failure should any planetary atmosphere be saturated with satellite craft. In order to mitigate this disaster, there should be an open standard of astronavigation that can demonstrate all potential flight paths that can coexist in a periodic fashion.

Thirdly, our ability to achieve novel goals in astrocolonization is hindered by our low tolerance for risk of failure. This risk of failure is too high in many individual missions, and makes iterative missions practically impossible.
 By demonstrating a cooperating cluster of individual missions, like multi-stage satellite constellations, we have already demonstrated that iterative missions can be designed for more ambitious goals.
 This first stage can, should there be an immutable interplanetary communication protocol, provide the foundation upon which more abstract layers of astrocolonization can occur. This phenomenon may be our shortest path to achieving technological advancements in the spirit of the Kardashev scale.

In practice, there are three milestones:

Firstly, there should one successful mission of deploying a constellation, to geocentric orbit, of a craft with the following specifications:
    
    The hardware and software should be an open source fabrication of all necessary components and capabilities.
    
    The craft must have a redundant high-latency telemetry and communications ASIC system.
    
    The craft must have an energy-efficient computational, communication, and consensus architecture.
    
    The craft must have a redundant and autonomous propulsion system that prioritizes longevity over impulsivity. 
    This system should last only as long as the prescribed lifespan of the craft, with allowance for end-of-life sequestration.
    
    The craft must have a redundant, parallel energy collection, storage, and distribution system.
    While solar energy may be the easiest and only source for the first iterative mission,
    there may be an application in further iterations that demands solar-independent energy sources, such as plutonium-based power generators.
    This system should last only as long as the prescribed lifespan of the craft, with allowance for end-of-life sequestration.
    
    The prescribed lifespan of the craft must overlap further missions of the same format, with allowance for forking codebase.

Secondly, there should be one more successful mission of deploying a constellation, to Mars-centric orbit, of a craft with the aforementioned specifications.
 This mission should demonstrate stable communication and concensus between nodes of two planetary systems, with allowance, but not a requirement, for potential lower-latency, intraplanetary data transfer and storage.

Thirdly, there should be one more successful mission of deploying a constellation to heliocentric orbit in a manner that utilizes gravitational assists from multiple bodies.
 This mission should demonstrate the potential for more esoteric missions, such as deploying automatons to low-gravity environments, or designating flight paths where increased craft durability and maneuverability is necessary.

This is not feasible in the imminent future, but is a continuation of thought experiments such as the paperclip machine. Pursuing this goal is a necessary step in the furtherance of the human civilization and the demonstration of ethically neutral technology.
