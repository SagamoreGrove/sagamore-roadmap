This is going to be the roughest of drafts for one of the intermediate goals of SagamoreGrove: provision of an environment by which the Five College consortium can be facilitated to pursue autonomous decision-making processes and create innovative, commercial and humanitarian, implementations thereof.

Firstly, this system should use a verification process that proves an identity via a non-spoofable .edu email domain. This should be segmented to each member of the Five College consortium.
 For example, only students that have been admitted to Mount Holyoke should be native agents within the Mount Holyoke environment, and only native agents within the Mount Holyoke environment should be able to sign a valid message or vote to the "Mount Holyoke"-sovereign entity.

This verification process should lead to a decentralized ID protocol that can allow for multiplexed sets of interactions between segments of the Five College consortium, its faculty, staff, and students, and any novel corporations that spin off with discretely attributable IP.

In other words, this communication process should be hardened against fraudulent attribution of academic works and any commercial entities, including individual actors, that seek to exploit the value therein.
 However, this communication process must facilitate the economic viability of commercial applications of academically-based IP and fair value compensation of good faith constituents thereof. 
 This can occur autonomously, and should bypass any gatekeeper norm that currently exists. 

In practice, IP should be submitted anonymously and privately via a hash function. Cosigners to academic papers, for example, could concurrently host an encrypted copy of their work in separate digital locations, only making public the cryptographic hash of that work.
 For less formal events, such as code contributions and acts of public service, clusters of FCC-segment constituents can sign the cache of social media submissions as proofs to be voted on in the greater DAO as valid.

The intent of this environment is to increase interoperability, and as such, there should be compensation for good faith actors that host partial and/or complete archives over substantial, overlapping time periods.
 These archives would be obfuscated and encrypted to prevent accidental disclosure of the underlying IP to malicious commercial entities.
 On the other hand, there can be some methodology by which a commercial entity can apply these IP by being a good faith actor with provable access at the time of release, and in so doing, compensate the original authors, actors, and cosigners for their service.
 This compensation can be described in terms that allow it to be fair value of the contribution, without diluting such contributions.

One challenge to keep in mind is that a tradeoff must be considered when a derivative work provides more capital-efficient or economically valuable methodology.
 In so doing, there must be compensation for the cited works, but also fair value compensation for the economical value that the derivative work provides. 
 There must be emphasis on autonomous compensation, and on the other side, sybil-resistant DAO-decreed disqualification. There needs to be a discussion for how heavy the implications are.

Additionally, there should be a microservices architecture that accompanies this social structure. If CS-literate actors can demonstrate a resilient and secure mesh of processes in addition to data storage and cryptographic verification, then there is an easier way to create an open market of compensation.
 This also allows further accessibility outside of the Pioneer Valley, which may be a necessary step for any commercial entity that orginates in PV but must scale out further.
  This also increases the potential for interoperability on multiple layers, and should be considered a primary discussion to be maintained for the community's benefit.
